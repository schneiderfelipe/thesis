\chapter{Concluding remarks and closing}%
\label{ch:conclusion}

The present thesis described approaches to the elucidation of reaction
mechanisms in general and the elucidation of specific reaction mechanisms in
particular.
Two computational-experimental collaborations have been presented and a third
purely computational publication detailed the development of an open-source
library and command-line application for automating the investigation of
reaction mechanisms.
