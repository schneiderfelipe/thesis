\begin{resumo}[Abstract]
	CHECK THE QUALIFICATION.\@

	The key question is whether we can calculate reaction mechanisms quantitatively
	using solely computational methods.

	We have developed a framework for the calculation of reaction mechanisms and
	contributed to the elucidation of some key mechanisms with and without the use
	of the framework.

	Especial contributions were given in detail for some of the mechanisms.
	In particular, we pinpointed the most important sources of error in the
	calculations.

	In conclusion, further work is needed to include the role of solvents and
	conformations in a quantitative way.

	REMEMBER:\@ ABSTRACT IS A STANDALONE DOCUMENT.\@
