\chapter{Scientific contributions}
\label{ch:contributions}

This chapter lists all articles and software co-authored by the author during
the course of his~PhD (March 2017--December 2022) at the Federal University of
Santa Catarina that are relevant to the field of computational elucidation of
reaction mechanisms.
There are two groups of contributions: minor and major.
Minor contributions describe works investigating mechanisms where the impact or
main conclusions do not substantially draw from such elucidations. In the
author's view, major contributions are the ones that either contribute
substantially to the field, investigate rather complex mechanisms, or the
impact of the study would not have been possible without considerable
computational mechanistic analysis.
Other unrelated works and software can be found in~\cref{ch:all-works}.

\section{Minor contributions}%
\label{sec:minor-contributions}

The following articles were co-authored by the author during the course of his~PhD
and are relevant to the field of computational elucidation of reaction
mechanisms, but are considered minor contributions according to the above criteria.
As such, they will not be further discussed in this thesis:
%
\begin{itemize}
	\item \fullcite{Gross2018},
	\item \fullcite{Schneider2019}, and
	\item \fullcite{Almerindo2020}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Major contributions}%
\label{sec:major-contributions}

The next three chapters describe all articles and software that the author has co-authored
during the course of his~PhD that are considered major contributions towards the field of
computational elucidation of reaction mechanisms, given the definition above.
Such works are either directly relevant to the elucidation of rather complex reaction
mechanisms, or the scientific impact would likely not have been possible without a
computational mechanistic investigation:
%
\begin{itemize}
	\item \fullcite{Coelho_2019} (\cref{ch:paper1}),
	\item \fullcite{Oliveira_2020} (\cref{ch:paper2}), and
	\item \fullcite{Schneider_2022} (\cref{ch:paper3}).
\end{itemize}
%
The following software, associated by the last above publication, was developed during the
author's~PhD as well:
%
\begin{itemize}
	\item \fullcite{overreact2021zenodo} (\cref{ch:paper3}).
\end{itemize}
