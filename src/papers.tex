The present part presents contributed works,
co-authored by me during the course of my PhD
at the Federal University of Santa Catarina,
to the field of computational elucidation of reaction mechanisms.

Other papers
not relevant or only tangentially related to the field
can be found in the \autoref{ch:all-papers}.

\section{Minor contributions}%
\label{sec:minor-contributions}
The following papers were co-authored by me and were published
during my time as a PhD student,
but in my view constitute only minor contributions and
will thus only be mentioned in the present thesis.

\begin{itemize}
\item \citetext{Gross2018}
    \item \citetext{Schneider2019}
    \item \citetext{Almerindo2020}
\end{itemize}

\section{Major contributions}%
\label{sec:major-contributions}
The rest of this part presents papers that I co-authored, were published as
part of my PhD (after March 2017) and, in my view, constitute major contributions
to the field.
